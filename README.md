# flight-transponder
A Gmod addon that lets you see other player's names at range so you can identify who's who while flying.

Current Plan:
    -Create a swep that allows players to enable/disable a transponder that allows other players with the swep to see their name over them through walls and at any distance
    -Name should remain fixed size so that it is readable at any distance
